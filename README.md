# SupportalSupport
Simple workflow program to simplify searching within the Supportal database.

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP file
2. Unzip the folder (this might happen automatically)
3. Put the Workflow file into the folder "Users/[your username]/Library/Services". If the folder 'Library' does not show up in the folder [username] use the key combination `'command' + 'shift' + '.'` to show all hidden folders. (the same combination can be used to hide the hidden folders again)

## Use
1. Select text and right click within Chrome (the workflow only works within Chrome for now)
2. Select SupportalSupport from the dropdown menu (or Services -> SupportalSupport if there are too many services to show in the dropdown menu)
3. The webpage will already start loading in the background)
4. Select "Let's go!" or press enter if the search query is correct (this will redirect you to the Supportal webpage)
5. The selected text will automatically get copied to the clipboard

## Tips
Remove some unnecesary services (e.g. "Add to iTunes as a spoken track") to make the SupportalSupport service more accesible. This can be done in `System preferences` -> `Keyboard` -> `Shortcuts` -> `Services`.
